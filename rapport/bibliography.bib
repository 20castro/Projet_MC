	abstract = {This paper approaches the problem of computing the price of an Asian option in two different ways. Firstly, exploiting a scaling property, we reduce the problem to the problem of solving a parabolic PDE in two variables. Secondly, we provide a lower bound which is so accurate that it is essentially the true price.},
